#Goal: Adapting FIMMCherry for NCMM needs.

#Comments:
#We need more info about the python and library versions. Ideally a virtual environment suitable to run it on Github 
#should be available. Could not find an executible file on github, and compiling with out a requirements file will be a 
#guess work.
#PyQt4 is obsolete, not available on PyPI, also need python 2 (exact python version to be known yet).
#PyQt4 only available as source code in source code distribution archives for PyQt. You need to build it.

#Now PyQt5 or PyQt6 is used. PyQt4 -> 5 Conversion is not straight forward, PyQt5 has a different structure.
#I am guessing pandas version used must also be obsolete.
